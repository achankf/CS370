The compressed images do not seem to lose much details, despite that up to 70% of the Fourier coefficients were dropped.
Numerically speaking, the error values show that the errors are about (or less than) 8%.

In conclusion, image compression can eliminate many unecessary details with relatively little lost of quality.
